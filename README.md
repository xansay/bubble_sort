# bubble_sort
This Java program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
